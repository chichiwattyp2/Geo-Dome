##

**Dataverse is an open platform built on top of WebVR technologies that helps you build immersive experiences based on Google Sheets. No coding required.**

You can split your interactive experience into scenes ('tabs' in the spreadsheet) that link to each other. For each scene you can choose from the several visualization types available, including maps, treemaps, timelines and of course, 360 photos and videos.

Once you have written down your spreadsheet, you can paste it on the experience generator below, that will generate an url for you and enjoy it. The resulting interactive experiences is compatible with the main headsets: HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Go, GearVR and Google Cardboard; thanks to WebVR's magic. You can also have a decent experience navigation on Desktop browsers.

To **learn more about how to write your own Google Sheet** to generate a story, [go here](https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/DataVerse/wiki/How-it-works). Once you have it written, you can [paste it into the website](https://dataverse.xyz/#generate). We recommend that you make a copy of a [working example here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CNATrkZduUCPDqvY0okjDxTTRB2-AsWpNx0153sGnnI/edit) and tweak it to generate your own story. To learn more about the different visualizations you can put into your scenes, [head here](https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/DataVerse/wiki/Visualization-types).

If you are a **developer** and want to install your own copy of the software on your host, or extend the tool in any way, including writing your own visualizations, visit [this page](https://github.com/oscarmarinmiro/DataVerse/wiki/Notes-for-Developers).
